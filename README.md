# PELE Constrained-Strain-Parallel (PELE_ConStraParl)

Repository dedicated to preparing PELE adaptive simulations in MN5.

The current execution (run) and configuration (yaml) templates are specific for performing PELE refinement simulations starting from docked ligands.

The repository is prepared to allow:
- Regular PELE refinement simulations starting from docked ligands
- Constrained
- Strain
- Parallel
